# Weekly Report 1

## Overview

During the first week of the project, the main focus was on defining the project topic, setting the scope, and initializing the project repository with proper project management tools. The goal of this week was to ensure that the project is well planned and technically ready for further development in the upcoming weeks.

## Topic and Scope

The chosen project topic is **lossless text compression**, focusing on the implementation and comparison of two classical compression algorithms: **Huffman coding** and **LZ77**. The project aims to compress text files efficiently and restore them exactly to their original form after decompression. The scope was intentionally defined to be algorithm-focused, with emphasis on correctness, efficiency, and clean implementation rather than visualization or user interface features.

The programming language selected for the project is **Python**, as it is well suited for algorithmic development and testing. The scope of the project was assessed to be sufficiently challenging and appropriate for the course requirements.

## Repository and Project Setup

A GitHub repository was created for the project, and a clear directory structure was established, including separate folders for source code, tests, documentation, and sample data. GitHub Issues were enabled to support future task tracking and project management.

For dependency and environment management, **Poetry** was selected and configured. The `pyproject.toml` file defines the project metadata, Python version requirements, development dependencies, and tool configurations. This ensures reproducibility and consistency across development environments.

## Documentation

A detailed **Specification Document** was written, describing the problem being solved, the algorithms and data structures to be implemented, expected time and space complexities, and the core focus of the project. Additionally, a README file was created to explain the project purpose, structure, installation steps, and usage instructions.

## Next Steps

In the next week, the focus will shift to implementing the core compression algorithms and writing unit tests alongside the code. Initial versions of Huffman coding and LZ77 will be developed, and testing will be expanded to verify correctness and robustness.
