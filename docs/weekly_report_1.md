# Weekly Report 1

## Time spent
Approximately 8–10 hours.

## What did I do this week?
During the first week of the project, I focused on planning and setting up the foundation for the entire project. I selected the project topic, defined its scope, and initialized the project repository. I also set up the development environment and project management tools to ensure that further development can proceed smoothly.

In addition, I wrote the initial documentation, including the specification document and the project README.

## How has the program progressed?
At this stage, the project has not yet progressed to algorithm implementation, but it is now fully prepared for development. The repository structure is in place, dependency management is configured, and the project is technically ready for coding and testing in the coming weeks.


## What did I learn this week/today?
This week reinforced the importance of careful project planning before starting implementation. Defining the scope early helped clarify what the project will and will not include. I also gained more experience using Poetry for dependency and environment management, which will be useful for maintaining a clean and reproducible development setup.

## What remains unclear or has been challenging?
One challenge was deciding how broad the project scope should be while still keeping it manageable within the course timeframe. Balancing ambition with realism required careful consideration. At this point, the high-level plan is clear, but some implementation details will become clearer once coding begins.

## What will I do next?
Next week, I will start implementing the core algorithms of the project, beginning with Huffman coding. I will also begin writing unit tests alongside the implementation to verify correctness from the start.
