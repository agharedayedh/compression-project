# Weekly Report 4

## Time Spent
Approximately 8–10 hours.

## What did I do this week?
This week I focused on preparing the project for peer review. I ensured that the core
functionality of the program is nearly complete and stable. Huffman coding is fully
implemented and tested, and the LZ78 algorithm has a working encoder and decoder.

I improved documentation and testing, started writing the implementation document, and
added additional tests beyond basic unit tests to better validate the overall correctness
of the project.

## How has the program progressed?
The project is now in a state where meaningful feedback can be given. The main functionality
is observable and runnable, tests pass reliably, and test coverage is tracked. The codebase
is structured clearly, and documentation has reached a usable initial level.

## What did I learn this week?
I learned how to evaluate my code from a reviewer’s perspective, focusing on clarity,
documentation, and test completeness. I also gained more experience structuring
implementation documentation and explaining design decisions in a clear way.

## What remains unclear or has been challenging?
The main challenge is deciding how far to go with optimization at this stage versus keeping
the implementation simple and readable. Designing a clean binary representation for
compressed data remains an open question for later stages.

## What will I do next?
Next, I will consider the peer review feedback, refine the LZ78 implementation, expand testing
further, and continue developing the implementation and testing documents with more detailed
analysis.
